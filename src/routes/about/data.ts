const aboutMeTxt = `Passionate about IT, I began learning web development 4 years ago.
        Today I master technologies like NodeJS, CSS, and many more.
        More than anything I love automation and learning new things, so in addition of the Web Developer Master Degree I'm following, I started learning DevOps and its benefits.
        Today I'm able to build full-stack applications, deploy them on my own server and manage them with ease.`;
